# Greeblz

Greeblz is a project to bring the feel of kitbashing plastic figure kits to the web

## Da Plan

This is a super pre-alpha prototype that I haven't touched in 3 years. It kinda works. It shows the 
idea has some legs. I don't have the basic assets in this repo (yet).

1. Rewrite in Typescript and React
1. Update libs
1. Get working on google firebase
1. Develop content
1. Unleash on a unsuspecting world

## Tips

Tips are always welcome and will be used for coffee, hardware, software, and hosting costs
